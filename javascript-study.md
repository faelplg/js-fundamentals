# JavaScript Complete Study - The practical guide

> **Why is it called JavaScript?**  
> When JavaScript was created, it was originally named “LiveScript.” However, since Java was extremely popular at the time, the language was renamed to “JavaScript” to capitalize on Java’s popularity and market it as a “younger brother” of Java.
> But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
