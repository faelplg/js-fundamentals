## MDN Web Docs (Mozilla)

It is the most complete, up-to-date, didactic reference focused on real-world applications of the language.

## ECMAScript Specification

Use it only in cases where you want to know exactly how JS works under the hood (engineer level). I recommend leaving it for a more advanced moment.

# Understanding JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is mainly known as the scripting language for web pages but is also used in non-browser environments like Node.js, CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat.

JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, and dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

## Key Dynamic Features

- Runtime object creation
- Variable argument functions
- Dynamic code execution (via `eval`)
- Object introspection (`for...in`, `Object` utilities)
- Source code recovery (`toString()`)

## Standards

- ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262)
- ECMAScript Internationalization API (ECMA-402)

New features may appear in browsers before the specification is finalized (usually between stage 3 and 4 of the standardization process).

> **Important Note:**  
> Do not confuse JavaScript with Java. Despite similar names, they are different languages with distinct syntax, semantics, and use cases.
